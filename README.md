# Problems

This repository contains my personal Java solutions of some common programming problems.

Problem5.java is a solution of the common developer's problem described as:
"Write a program that outputs all possibilities to put + or - or nothing between the numbers 1, 2, ..., 9 
(in this order) such that the result is always 100. For example: 1 + 2 + 34 – 5 + 67 – 8 + 9 = 100".

Quicksort.java is a java solution of the quicksort algorithm.

Bubblesort.java is a java solution of the bubblesort algorithm.
